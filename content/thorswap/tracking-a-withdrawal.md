# Tracking a withdrawal

These instructions can be used for any of the following scenarios:

- Withdrawing from an LP
- Withdrawing from Savers/Earn
- Closing a loan

## Procedure

1. Visit the [9R THORChain Tracker]
1. Use Ctrl-F or Command-F to search the web page for the **last 4 digits of your destination wallet address**
   - "Destination wallet address" means the address to which the funds are being sent (withdrawn) to
   - **DO NOT use the "Swap Transaction ID" search box at the top of the page!**

If your transaction is found, check to see which queue it's in; this will give
you an idea of how long it will be before your transaction makes it onto the
blockchain.  Refer to [THORChain queues](../thorchain/queues.md) for details.

To check the condition of your loan, refer to [Loan status](../thorchain/loan-status.md) for details.
