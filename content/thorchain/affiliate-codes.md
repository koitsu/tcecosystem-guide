# Affiliate codes

Affiliate codes are actually just [THORNames], but figuring out who registered
them is tricky.  THORChain and RuneScan/Viewblock devs sometimes know who uses
what, but this information is not always made public.

THORNames, therefore affiliate codes, are [case-insensitive][1].

Below is a list of codes obtained from various THORChain community resources,
from Flipside queries to contributors to Medium articles.  If you can contribute
to this chart, please submit a PR via GitHub.
