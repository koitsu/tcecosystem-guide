# THORChain

- THORChain only supports Native Segwit and legacy Segwit Bitcoin (BTC) addresses.  **Taproot IS NOT supported!  Use of a Taproot address will result in loss of funds!**
- Repaying a loan (Lending/Borrow) can sometimes leave a small amount left on the loan, making it difficult to close the loan given THORChain's minimum transaction sizes.  To work around this problem, try repaying the loan using an asset which can get you the granularity you need to close the loan.  BNB (BEP20/BSC), DOGE, and RUNE tend to be good choices (granular and cheaper gas).
