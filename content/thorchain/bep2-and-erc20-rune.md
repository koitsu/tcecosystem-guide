# BEP2 and ERC20 RUNE

BEP2 RUNE was officially announced as deprecated in July 2022 when
[KillSwitch] was enabled.  This period lasted 12 months.

By July 2023, both BEP2 RUNE and ERC20 RUNE were
[officially unsupported by THORChain][1].

THORSwap also effectively removed support for both, including the
"RUNE-to-native-RUNE" converter mentioned in [past YouTube videos][2].

## BEP2

As of February 10th 2024, two (2) exchanges [Bybit] and [Coinlocally] are no
longer accepting BEP2 RUNE deposits.  It is unknown whether or not such
deposits will be restored.

As of this writing there are no known ways to convert BEP2 RUNE into native
RUNE or another asset.

## ERC20

Swap or sell the ERC20 RUNE on any Ethereum DEX for whatever you can get for
it.  Uniswap is one such DEX.
