# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to act as a "community guide", consisting of
how-tos and FAQs for things relating to THORChain.  This includes instructions
for how to achieve tasks on front-ends (such as THORSwap).

While this site originally started as a GitHub Gist written exclusively by one
person, over time more and more people began contributing information and
reviewing procedures.  At times, even official front-ends refer users to some
of the procedures here!

We hope that you find the information here beneficial.

## Technical details

This site is written entirely in [Markdown].  Pages are rendered by [mdBook], a
documentation-oriented static-site generator.

The site is auto-generated by [GitHub Actions] every time there is a commit
pushed to the official GitHub repository.

Users who are technically-inclined and wish to make contributions are welcome
to do so via pull requests.
